//  Is this relationship many to many ? I figured since each 
//animal is unique and we don't have a stock of identical
//animals it would be a one-many relationship
//one cart can have multiple animals but one animal can't have
//multiple carts
// Please let me know if my logic is wrong, not sure i grasped the full 
//concept from class
